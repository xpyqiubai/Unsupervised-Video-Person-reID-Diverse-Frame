The state-of-the-art methods utilize clustering to obtain pseudo-labels and train the models iteratively. However, they underestimate the influence of two kinds of frames in the tracklet: 1) noise frames caused by detection errors or heavy occlusions exist in the tracklet, which may be allocated with unreliable labels during clustering; 2) the tracklet also contains hard frames caused by pose changes or partial occlusions, which are difficult to distinguish but informative.

## Illustration of the impact of noise and hard frames

**(a)** shows the feature space of integral and clean tracklet features, respectively. Due to the noise frames, the features of tracklets $a$ and $b$ have a high similarity, and they will be wrongly merged during clustering. When noise frames are trimmed, the features of clean tracklets $a'$ and $b'$ are able to be easily distinguished. **(b)** shows the feature space of frames in the tracklet. The hard frames are more scattered than easy frames and do not have the same high aggregation frame feature spaces as easy frames.
